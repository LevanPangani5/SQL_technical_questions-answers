-- The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop 
and a mobile application.
-- Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only 
and both mobile and desktop together for each date.

script:
create table spending 
(
user_id int,
spend_date date,
platform varchar(10),
amount int
);

insert into spending values(1,'2019-07-01','mobile',100),(1,'2019-07-01','desktop',100),(2,'2019-07-01','mobile',100)
,(2,'2019-07-02','mobile',100),(3,'2019-07-01','desktop',100),(3,'2019-07-02','desktop',100);

solution:
with cte as(
select spend_date,user_id, max(platform) as platform, sum(amount) as amount
from spending
group by spend_date,user_id
having count(distinct platform)=1
union all
select spend_date,user_id, 'both' as platform, sum(amount) as amount
from spending
group by spend_date,user_id
having count(distinct platform)=2)

select spend_date,platform,sum(amount) as amount, count(distinct user_id) as logins
from cte
group by spend_date, platform
order by spend_date
